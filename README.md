## THIS BRANCH ONLY :sparkles:

### Changes made

#### _In-game Notification Component_ added:

- `onSwipe` _(left, right, up)_: make it disappear, but the notification will return after a certain amount of time to remind the user to go talk to Janus.
- `onPress`: switch to Janus Conversation Screen (App SMS), and the notification will disappear for good.

#### _Janus Conversation Screen_ added to SMS App:

- `onPressBackButton`: explicitly return to the main page of SMS App (the list of SMS). Since for example if the user is on HomeScreen and press the Notification ==> switch to Janus Conversation Screen but the previous screen is HomeScreen, not the SMS App.
- Section **Reply to Janus / Multiple Choice** added: if answers are available, the user can chose one and press the _SEND_ button (icon) to send it to Janus.

#### Minor rework on _SMS Conversation Screen_ and _Janus Conversation Screen_:

- Always scroll to the bottom of the messages list.
- Rework / Improvements on each screen's layout, some shared components added.
